I translated our designer's mockup into a working prototype. It looks a little off, and that's because the files I'm using there and have pushed up to here are not the originals.

At the time, mobile-first design hadn't caught on yet and our analytics showed most of our users were using desktops to access the old site. As I was working on this, I started off with the desktop CSS, and when I started the mobile CSS, I quickly regretted not going mobile-first. It's so much easier to add things than to take them away. But I didn't want to scrap the whole thing and start over, so I persisted.

Along with Sousa Bows, this was one of my first forays into JavaScript, or more specifically, jQuery. I learned Java in college, and dabbled with Python as a teen, so I knew the basics of programming. I tried everything I could to avoid using JavaScript though, but some things I just couldn't do with CSS alone.

If I could do this whole thing over, I would:

1. Go mobile-first
2. Use a framework, like Bootstrap or Foundation, instead of writing CSS from scratch
3. Use real source control and not Google Drive
